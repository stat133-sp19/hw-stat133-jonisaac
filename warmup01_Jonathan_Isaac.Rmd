##__Euclidean Distance__

_Definition_
------------------------------------------------
The Euclidean distance between points p and q is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\overline{\textbf{pq}}$)

In Cartesian coordinates, if __p =__ $(p_1, p_2, ..., p_n)$ and __q =__ $(q_1, q_2, ..., q_n)$ are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from __p__ to __q__ or from __q__ to __p__ is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$d(\textbf{p,q}) = (\textbf{q,p}) = \sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2+(q_2-p_2)^2+... +(q_n-p_n)^2}$
$= \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (q_i-p_i)^2}$

The position of a point in a Euclidean _n_-space is a Euclidean vector. So, __p__ and __q__ may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The __Euclidean norm__, or __Euclidean length__, or __magnitude__ of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$||\textbf{p}|| = \sqrt{p_1^2 + p_2^2 + ... + p_n^2} = \sqrt{\textbf{p} \cdot \textbf{p}}$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
