**Euclidean Distance**
----------------------

*Definition*
------------

The Euclidean distance between points p and q is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\\overline{\\textbf{pq}}$)

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p =** (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q =** (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q** or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$d(\\textbf{p,q}) = (\\textbf{q,p}) = \\sqrt{(q\_1-p\_1)^2+(q\_2-p\_2)^2+... +(q\_n-p\_n)^2}$ $= \\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^{n} (q\_i-p\_i)^2}$

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$||\\textbf{p}|| = \\sqrt{p\_1^2 + p\_2^2 + ... + p\_n^2} = \\sqrt{\\textbf{p} \\cdot \\textbf{p}}$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
